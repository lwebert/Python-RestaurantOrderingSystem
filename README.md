## Contributing
This application was developed by Lauren Webert, with some code written by the University of Denver. Here are some guidelines on ways to contribute:

Report a bug fix.

1. Create a new Issue in the GitHub repo.

Make local changes to push up.

1. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b <your-feature-branch-name>`)
2. Make your changes locally
3. Push the code back to the GitHub repo (`git push origin <your-feature-branch-name>`)
4. Create a pull request to merge your changes

## Tests
The application is working correctly if, when the application is launched, a menu of each item's category, name and price is diplayed in the terminal, along with a prompt asking what you would like to order and the quantity. The user should be able to input numbers to the terminal. The application can handle invalid inputs, and will ask if they would like to continue ordering after an error and at the end of the ticket.
